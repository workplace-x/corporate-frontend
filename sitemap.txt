3. Proposed Optimal Sitemap
Based on the competitive analysis and Tangram’s goals (including integration with AI tools and project data), we propose the following optimal sitemap for a revamped Tangram Interiors website. This structure is designed to improve user experience, cover all of Tangram’s offerings and differentiators, and provide a foundation for new interactive features.
Home – A dynamic landing page with Tangram’s core message, visual highlights of work, key value propositions, and entry points to major sections (services, markets, projects).

.
Move Management & Facility Services – End-to-end move services, reconfigurations, asset storage, maintenance and facilities support.
(Each service page will detail scope, benefits, and relevant case examples, ensuring all five complementary business units are clearly represented.)
Markets (Industries Served) – Hub page (optional) plus dedicated pages for major sectors Tangram serves:
Workplaces (Corporate Offices) – Solutions for business offices, tech firms, media companies, and general corporate environments.
Healthcare – Solutions for hospitals, clinics, and wellness facilities (furniture, floor planning, patient-centered design).
Higher Education – University and college spaces (innovative classrooms, libraries, student centers).
K-12 Education – Learning environments for K-12 schools (flexible classrooms, STEAM spaces, collaborative zones).
Hospitality – Spaces such as hotels, lounges, and entertainment venues that Tangram has outfitted (focus on brand experience and comfort).
Government & Public Sector – Solutions for government offices, civic centers, and public institutions (emphasizing durability, flexibility, and public-serving design).
Projects – A portfolio section showcasing Tangram’s recent and signature projects across all markets. This page would allow filtering or browsing by industry (Workplace, Education, etc.) and by solution type if desired. Each project entry can link to a detailed case study (optional modal or sub-page) with photos, description of challenges/solutions, and outcomes.
Insights & News – A content hub combining blog articles, news, and thought leadership. This includes company news (press releases, new hires or offices), project spotlights, and informative articles (e.g. workplace strategy tips, design trend reports, research findings possibly leveraging Steelcase insights). Regular updates here will engage visitors and improve SEO, positioning Tangram as a knowledgeable leader.
Contact – A contact page with a clear call-to-action to get in touch. It should include a form (allowing visitors to request info or consultation), key contact info, and perhaps a prompt to connect with the nearest Tangram location.
Client Portal – (Secure section) An online portal for clients to log in and access project data – such as project status updates, furniture catalogs specific to their project, schedules, or support tickets. This will integrate with Tangram’s backend project management system. (This may be presented as a “Client Login” link in the header rather than a full public page, but is noted here for completeness of integration.)
Integration of AI Tooling: In addition to the pages above, the new site will be built to support an AI-driven virtual assistant accessible across the site. This could be an AI chat widget that helps answer visitor questions (e.g. “What services does Tangram offer in healthcare?” or “Show me furniture options for a conference room”) by leveraging the site’s content and Tangram’s project data. The sitemap supports this by having well-structured content for the AI to reference (each service and market clearly delineated). The AI assistant and possibly a recommendation engine (for related content or products) will be integrated throughout the user journey to enhance engagement. For example, on the Projects page, an AI tool might allow users to ask for projects similar to their industry or location, retrieving relevant case studies. This not only improves UX but also showcases Tangram’s commitment to innovation. The proposed sitemap ensures clear pathways for different user types: a potential client can easily find how Tangram would address their specific industry needs and see proof of performance (projects), an existing client can log into a portal for updates, a job seeker can find career info, and any visitor can quickly understand Tangram’s full capabilities and brand story. The structure is also scalable – new content (like additional markets or services) can be added over time, and the integration of AI/back-end systems is facilitated by having distinct content sections and a modern technical foundation.
4. Full Website Copy Draft (by sitemap page)
Below is the draft copy for each key page in the new Tangram Interiors website, aligned with the proposed sitemap. The copy is crafted to tell a cohesive brand story, highlight Tangram’s differentiators, and guide users with a conversion-oriented tone.

About Tangram – Our Story
Tangram Interiors began with a simple belief: the workspace should be an engine for human potential. For over 50 years, we’ve been crafting environments that do more than look good on a brochure – we create places where people feel good, perform their best, and build community. From our early days as a Southern California furniture dealer to our expansion as a full-service interiors powerhouse across California and Texas, Tangram’s journey has been defined by innovation and partnership. We’ve evolved with the times – embracing open-plan philosophies, ergonomic design, collaborative tech, and now data-driven and AI-enhanced planning – all to better serve our clients. Yet, our core values remain unchanged:
People-Centric Design: We put humans at the heart of every decision. Tangram’s design approach starts by understanding the people who will use a space – their aspirations, tasks, and challenges. Because a workspace is successful only if the people within it are thriving.
Integrity & Trust: We’ve built long-term relationships with clients, architects, and partners by being transparent, reliable, and accountable. Delivering on promises is part of our DNA.
Innovation with Purpose: Curiosity drives us. Whether it’s exploring new materials for a custom furniture piece or leveraging virtual reality to preview a layout, we embrace new ideas that add value. Innovation is never for its own sake – it’s always in service of creating better outcomes for you.
Today, Tangram Interiors is proud to be one of the largest Steelcase partners in North America, yet we operate with the soul of a boutique studio. That means you get the global resources and cutting-edge insights of the world’s premier office furniture manufacturer, paired with the personalized attention of a dedicated local team. We measure our success not by the number of chairs or walls installed, but by the smiles on move-in day, the boost in collaboration and morale after a reimagining, and the long-term partnerships we forge. Our name, Tangram, comes from a puzzle made of simple pieces that can be arranged into endless combinations. For us, it’s a perfect metaphor: we take the pieces of your vision – ideas, people, technology, brand, budget – and assemble them into a workspace that’s uniquely yours. No two solutions are alike, because no two clients are alike. Come meet the team behind the scenes, explore our locations, and see why Tangram is crafting tomorrow’s workspaces today.
Leadership & Team
Behind every Tangram success story is our talented team – a diverse group of designers, project managers, strategists, installers, and support staff all united by a passion for excellence. We’re proud to introduce our leadership, who set the vision and tone for everything we do: Sonya Lozowski – Chairman: A visionary leader blending a background in medicine with a passion for design, Sonya champions Tangram’s human-centered approach. Under her guidance, Tangram prioritizes wellness, innovation, and community in every project. Joe Lozowski – President & CEO: Since 2002, Joe has led Tangram’s transformation from a regional dealer to an interiors industry leader. His strategic discipline and entrepreneurial spirit rebuilt Tangram from the ground up – taking us to over $250M in revenue and expanding our capabilities far beyond furniture. Joe’s mantra: always put the client first and foster a culture where employees thrive. (Fun fact: Joe also once chaired Steelcase’s Dealer Advisory Board, forging even stronger ties with our key partner.) Nick Meter – Vice President of Sales: Nick is the driving force behind Tangram’s sales and client development. Starting as a salesperson and rising through the ranks, he knows every facet of our business units – from Technology to Studio Other – and has a knack for understanding client needs. Nick ensures that Tangram’s solutions not only win business, but truly deliver on what’s promised. (And many more...) Our broader Tangram family includes 200+ professionals across multiple offices. When you work with Tangram, you’re engaging a team that loves what they do and cares deeply about your project. We invest in continuous learning – from ergonomics certifications to AI technology training – so that our team brings fresh ideas and proven expertise to the table. Whether you’re interacting with a project designer in our Dallas office, a flooring specialist in Fresno, or a customer support rep in Los Angeles, you’ll find the same commitment: friendly, responsive service and a can-do attitude. We believe our people are our biggest strength – and by extension, they become your strength as we work together. Collaboration is not just a buzzword to us; it’s how we operate internally too. Expect us to partner seamlessly with your architects, contractors, and facilities teams. Our leaders set that example from the top down, ensuring every Tangram member works as one integrated unit to achieve your goals. Want to put faces to the names and see what drives us?

We stand on the shoulders of giants, working closely with top manufacturers and aligning with our clients’ teams to bring world-class solutions to life. Our Manufacturer Partners: Chief among our partners is Steelcase, the global leader in workplace furniture and research. As a proud Steelcase Premier Partner, we integrate their state-of-the-art products – from ergonomic seating to architecturally integrated office pods – into our solutions
tangraminteriors.com
. This partnership means our clients benefit from Steelcase’s unparalleled quality, extensive product catalog, and ongoing research into how workplaces can foster wellbeing and productivity. Tangram is consistently one of Steelcase’s top-performing dealer partners, a testament to the depth of our collaboration. But our ecosystem extends beyond Steelcase. We’ve cultivated relationships with dozens of manufacturers and craftspeople to meet any need. A few highlights:
Design Furniture Brands: We source from iconic design houses like MillerKnoll (Herman Miller and Knoll collections), Teknion, Haworth, and boutique makers for specialty pieces. This means we can provide the perfect chair, table, or light fixture to match your aesthetic and functional requirements.
Architectural & Tech Partners: Tangram teams up with innovators in demountable wall systems, acoustic solutions, and AV technology (e.g., Microsoft Surface Hub, Crestron, Poly equipment) to ensure all components of your space work in harmony. Our Tangram Technology unit often co-develops solutions with these partners to push the envelope of smart office design.
Flooring and Finishes: Through our flooring division, we partner with trusted flooring manufacturers (carpet, LVT, hardwood) and even window treatment providers to deliver cohesive interior finishes. We have go-to alliances with brands known for durability and style, ensuring your floors and shades perform as beautifully as they look.
Client Success Stories: Our true pride lies in the partnerships we’ve forged with clients across industries. Each project is a collaboration – a journey we undertake together from the first brainstorm to the final walk-through. We’re honored that over 70% of our business comes from repeat clients and referrals, a reflection of the trust and rapport we build. On our roster of clients you’ll find Fortune 500 corporations, innovative startups, educational institutions, healthcare providers, and more. We’ve helped a global entertainment studio design collaborative post-production spaces that wow visiting talent. We’ve worked hand-in-hand with a healthcare network to furnish multiple clinics focused on patient comfort and provider efficiency. We’ve partnered with a leading university to reimagine their library and student centers for 21st-century learning.

Contract Furniture (Service Page)
Crafting Inspiring Workspaces through Furniture. At Tangram, contract furniture is far more than tables and chairs – it’s the foundation upon which your entire workplace experience is built. Our Contract Furniture Solutions team excels in creating work environments that are functional, beautiful, and uniquely you. Whether you’re furnishing a sleek corporate HQ, a cozy collaborative lounge, or a high-energy startup hub, we guide you through every step:
Expert Space Planning: Our designers analyze your space and workflow to determine the optimal layout. We consider everything – headcount growth, traffic flow, natural light, and even the mood you want to set. The result is a furniture plan that maximizes your real estate and fosters productivity.
Best-in-Class Products: As a premier Steelcase dealer, we offer ergonomic seating, height-adjustable desks, smart conference tables, and more from the industry’s leading collections. Need something specific? We also source from dozens of partner brands (Herman Miller, Knoll, etc.) to find the perfect pieces for your style and budget. From timeless classics to cutting-edge designs fresh from Milan, we have you covered.
Tailored Solutions: We don’t do cookie-cutter. Every selection is aligned with your brand and culture. If your law firm needs an atmosphere of quiet sophistication, we might choose rich wood veneers and plush seating. If your creative agency thrives on playfulness, expect vibrant colors and modular setups. Tangram’s vast portfolio ensures your furniture not only fits the space – it tells your story.
Seamless Delivery & Installation: Our project managers and certified installation crews handle all the logistics. We coordinate orders, deliveries, and assembly down to the last detail. Installation is timed to minimize disruption, and before we’re done, we’ll walk through every inch to ensure it’s perfect. Day 1, you’ll be ready to plug in and get to work – and we’ll haul away all the packaging, of course.
Ongoing Support: Our relationship doesn’t end at installation. We provide training on adjusting that fancy new chair or table if needed. And as your needs evolve – perhaps you reconfigure teams or expand – we’re here with reconfiguration services, warranty support, and inventory management. Your furniture is a long-term investment; Tangram helps you care for it and adapt it over time.
Why Tangram for Furniture? It’s simple: we blend creativity with practicality. Clients tell us they appreciate how we can make a space look straight out of a design magazine while still meeting their every operational need. We also know the contract furniture process can be complex – so many options, lead times, budgets – but our experienced team makes it easy and even enjoyable. We listen, then we deliver the right solution. Perhaps most importantly, we understand that furniture influences how people feel at work. The right chair can improve concentration and health. The right collaboration area can spark big ideas. When you partner with Tangram, you get furniture that works as hard as you do. Ready to sit better, work smarter, and wow visitors? Let’s pick out your perfect workspace ensemble together. Explore our Furniture Projects → or Contact us for a consultation →.
Architectural Walls (Service Page)
Defining Spaces with Flexibility and Flair. Tangram’s Architectural Walls team brings you the future of walls: movable, sustainable, tech-friendly wall systems that adapt to your needs. Say goodbye to fixed drywall and hello to agile spaces. Imagine being able to reconfigure your office layout in a day – turning one large conference room into two smaller meeting spaces, or opening up a closed office into a collaborative area – without demolition or downtime. That’s the power of demountable walls, and Tangram is Southern California’s leader in this innovative domain. What We Offer:
Demountable Wall Systems: Beautifully engineered wall solutions from top manufacturers (including Steelcase’s architectural solutions and others) that can include glass panels, solid panels, integrated doors, and more. These walls provide the look and sound privacy of permanent construction, but can be moved or reconfigured as your business evolves.
Custom Applications: Need a branded wall with your company logo etched in glass? A writeable whiteboard wall spanning an entire room? We love creating custom touches. Our design and fabrication teams (including Studio Other) can incorporate unique materials or graphics so your walls aren’t just dividers – they’re features.
Technology Integration: Our walls are smart. We plan for power and data integration, mount screens or interactive displays, and ensure your new walls work seamlessly with room-booking systems or other tech. For example, we can include built-in LED accent lighting or integrate privacy glass that tints at the flip of a switch.
Acoustic Performance: One concern with open-plan offices is noise. Architectural walls are a great solution – they carve out quiet zones and meeting rooms with excellent acoustics. Tangram specifies wall systems with high STC (Sound Transmission Class) ratings, meaning confidential conversations stay private and distractions stay out.
Speed & Sustainability: Installing architectural walls is fast and clean – often 75% faster than building standard walls. There’s minimal dust, and if you ever move, you can take the walls with you. Plus, these systems are environmentally friendly: many use recycled materials and contribute to green building credits. Rather than tearing down and sending debris to landfills, reconfigure and reuse! It’s a win for you and the planet.
Why Tangram for Walls? It comes down to our comprehensive approach. We don’t just drop a product in your lap; we handle design, coordination, and execution. Our experts collaborate with your architects and contractors to ensure the wall layouts align perfectly with ceilings, floors, and HVAC or sprinkler systems. We create detailed visualizations so you can see how the walls will look and function in your space before we install. And our trained technicians assemble everything with precision. Clients who embrace architectural walls enjoy long-term cost savings and agility. Need to hire 10 people and add two offices? Easy. Want to refresh the look of a room? Swap out panel finishes instead of rebuilding. Tangram has implemented these solutions in corporate offices, healthcare clinics (think glass partitions in patient areas), and educational facilities alike – optimizing space without sacrificing aesthetic. Give your workplace the walls that do it all – design, flexibility, sustainability. Let Tangram show you how to divide and conquer your space challenges with style. (Curious to see walls in action? Check out our case study on a tech client who reinvented their space using our wall systems, or visit our showroom for a demo.)
Technology Integration (Service Page)
Where Space Meets Tech – Seamlessly. Tangram Technology is our dedicated division that bridges the gap between great workspace design and the powerful technology that today’s offices require. In an age of hybrid work and constant connectivity, we make sure your physical environment and digital tools work in harmony to keep your team connected, whether they’re across the table or across the world. Here’s how we bring cutting-edge tech solutions into your workplace design:
Smart Conference Rooms: We outfit meeting spaces with top-tier audiovisual systems – crystal-clear displays or projectors, immersive sound, and user-friendly controls. Imagine walking into a conference room and starting your video meeting with one touch, confident that everyone remote is heard and seen as if they were in the room. From Zoom rooms to high-end boardroom setups, we handle design and installation end-to-end.
Collaboration Everywhere: Need a brainstorm corner with an interactive whiteboard? Or phone booths with built-in video conferencing for private calls? We integrate technology into all types of zones. Tangram can incorporate wireless presentation systems, digital whiteboards, charging solutions, and beyond, wherever collaboration happens.
Integrated Furniture & Tech: We love bringing furniture and tech together. Think chairs with IoT sensors that monitor space usage (so you know which areas are popular), or desks with built-in wireless chargers and cable management that keeps things tidy. Our partnerships with innovative brands let us offer solutions like smart lockers for IT equipment, or sensor networks that help facilities teams optimize lighting/HVAC based on occupancy. Your office itself can be intelligent.
Acoustics & Privacy: Technology integration isn’t just visible gadgets – it’s also behind-the-scenes enhancements. We deploy sound masking systems (subtle background sound that makes speech less intelligible at a distance) to increase speech privacy in open offices. We can install electronic privacy glass in conference rooms that frost over for confidential meetings. We ensure your network and power infrastructure is up to snuff so all these tech elements run smoothly.
Training and Support: New technology can be daunting for users. Tangram doesn’t drop equipment and disappear – we provide training sessions so your employees feel comfortable using the fancy new interactive display or room control tablet. We also remain available for ongoing support. And when it’s time to upgrade or expand, we’ll be there to advise on the latest and greatest (because tech moves fast!).
Why Tangram for Tech? Because we understand both the design implications and the technical details. Our Technology team speaks the language of IT departments (bandwidth, connectivity, security) and that of designers (aesthetics, integration, user experience). We ensure that adding tech doesn’t mean adding eyesores – no messy wires here, and devices will be coordinated with your interior style. Crucially, we approach tech as an enabler of culture and productivity. We’ll ask: How do your teams work? Do they need more tools for virtual brainstorming? Better setups for focus and concentration? Safer, touch-free interactions? Then we tailor solutions accordingly. A well-integrated workplace means your staff isn’t fighting with equipment – the space naturally supports their flow of work. From startup co-working areas to Fortune 100 executive briefing centers, Tangram has delivered technology solutions that make our clients say “Wow!”. Let’s make your space not just current, but future-ready. With Tangram’s Technology Integration, your office will feel high-performance and effortless – a place where innovation thrives.
Custom Furniture – Studio Other (Service Page)
Welcome to Studio Other, Tangram’s custom craft studio where imagination becomes reality. Here, we push beyond the catalogue to create one-of-a-kind furniture and environments that truly reflect the identity and needs of your organization. If you’ve ever thought, “I wish we had a [fill in the blank] that was uniquely ours,” Studio Other is the team that can make it. What is Studio Other? It’s our in-house design and fabrication workshop, staffed by a team of inventive designers, engineers, and craftsmen who thrive on challenges. The name “Other” signifies thinking outside the box – alternative solutions for those special requests and creative ideas that standard products can’t satisfy. What We Do:
Signature Pieces: Looking for a reception desk that makes a bold statement? Collaborative workstations custom-sized to your space’s angles? A wall installation that doubles as an art piece? We design and build signature furniture and fittings from scratch. Materials, form, function – all tailored to you. Our team has created everything from custom banquettes upholstered in client-branded colors to innovative work pods shaped like eggs for extra privacy. If you can dream it, we’ll bring it to life.
Custom Modifications: Sometimes a product almost fits the bill but needs a tweak. Studio Other can modify existing furniture designs or mash up concepts to achieve the perfect solution. For example, we might take a standard workstation system and customize the storage components to better fit your equipment. Or alter a conference table’s dimensions and finish to align with a unique room and your CEO’s vision.
Fabrication & Quality: We don’t just sketch ideas; we build them with meticulous care. Studio Other leverages a network of skilled artisans and advanced fabrication facilities. We work with wood, metal, glass, solid surface, 3D printing – the right medium for the right design. Every piece undergoes Tangram’s quality checks for durability and finish. Custom doesn’t mean delicate; we ensure your investment stands up to daily use.
Branded Environments: Your workspace can be a powerful expression of your brand. Studio Other often collaborates with clients to incorporate logos, brand colors, and thematic elements into furniture or installations. Think custom graphics on room dividers, tables in the shape of your logo, or a wall feature that tells your company’s story. These touches create a sense of place that is unmistakably you.
Collaborative Process: What sets Studio Other apart is how closely we work with you (and your architects/designers if applicable). We start by understanding the challenge or vision. Then we sketch concepts, develop renderings or even 3D prototypes, and refine them with your feedback. You’ll be as involved as you want to be – some clients love being hands-on in choosing materials or visiting our shop to see progress! The result is a collaborative creation, not just a product.
Why go custom with Tangram? Because sometimes, the best solution is one that hasn’t been made yet. Custom elements can maximize your space (fitting into that odd nook or multi-purpose area perfectly), amplify functionality (maybe you need a combination storage + seating + divider piece), and elevate aesthetics (a unique focal point that wows visitors and staff alike). And with Tangram, you get custom capabilities backed by the reliability of a large firm – we handle all the details, including ensuring any custom piece meets building codes, safety requirements, and integrates with the rest of your furniture plan. Clients who experience Studio Other often tell us it was a highlight of their project. There’s something special about seeing an idea go from a napkin sketch to a tangible piece in your office. We invite you to bring us your challenges and your wildest ideas. Studio Other will deliver solutions that are functional art, unique to your organization. (P.S. The name might be “Other,” but for you, it’ll feel one-of-a-kind.) Ready to create something extraordinary? Let’s design your signature piece.

Flooring & Specialty Interiors (Service Page)
From the Ground Up – Flooring & More. Often overlooked but absolutely essential, flooring is literally the foundation of your space’s look and feel. Tangram’s Flooring & Specialty Interiors team ensures that from the moment someone steps into your environment, they feel quality, cohesion, and comfort. But we don’t stop at floors – our expertise extends to other interior finish trades that complete the picture, offering you a one-stop solution for cohesive interiors. Our Flooring Solutions:
Broadloom & Carpet Tile: Soft surfaces for comfort, acoustics, and style. We provide a vast range of carpet options – from plush broadlooms that add luxury to executive areas to modular carpet tiles that allow creative patterns and easy replacement in high-traffic zones. We’ll help you choose patterns and textures that complement your design and stand up to wear (and yes, we think about maintenance too – like stain-resistant fibers for those inevitable coffee spills).
Hard Surface Flooring: Sleek, durable options like LVT (luxury vinyl tile), hardwood, engineered wood, ceramic tile, and polished concrete finishes. Whether you want the warm elegance of wood grain or the modern edge of concrete, we handle specification and installation. Our team factors in foot traffic, cleaning protocols, and longevity to recommend the right material for each area – be it a lobby, cafeteria, or lab.
Raised Access Floors: For mission-critical spaces like data centers or offices that require flexibility in wiring, raised floor systems can be a game-changer. Tangram installs raised access flooring that hides cables and HVAC beneath your feet, with easy panels for access. Your space stays clean and adaptable to technological change, and the floor can be finished with carpet or hard surfaces for a seamless look.
Specialty Interiors:
Window Treatments: Natural light is wonderful – until it’s a glare on your screen. We’ve got you covered (literally) with blinds, shades, and drapery solutions. From motorized solar shades that integrate with your lighting system to elegant fabric drapes for conference rooms, we balance aesthetics, light control, and energy efficiency. Let the sunshine in when you want, and close it out when you need focus or privacy.
Wall Coverings & Specialty Finishes: Add personality and performance to your vertical surfaces. We can provide everything from vinyl wall coverings and writable paint (turn that wall into a whiteboard!) to acoustic wall panels or custom 3D wall features. These “finishing touches” can dramatically improve acoustics and add visual impact. Our team ensures any specialty wall elements coordinate with your overall palette and meet fire/safety codes.
Cabinetry & Millwork: Need custom storage units, a pantry kitchenette, or built-in cabinets for a clean, tailored interior? We coordinate with millwork partners (or our own fabrication resources) to design and install casework that fits perfectly and matches your finishes. This often goes hand-in-hand with our flooring and furniture work, delivering a turnkey interior solution.
The Tangram Difference: Handling flooring and related trades through Tangram means simplicity and accountability. Rather than juggling multiple vendors (one for carpet, one for wood floors, another for blinds, etc.), you have a single point of contact. We create a coordinated schedule so your build-out runs smoothly – for example, flooring goes in at the right time relative to furniture delivery. We also ensure consistency in design: the tone of your wood floor will complement the fabric on your chairs; the pattern on your carpet tile might even subtly echo your brand motif. It’s all part of a unified vision. Our flooring team is led by industry veterans who know the technical ins-and-outs: subfloor prep, moisture barriers, slip coefficients – we handle the nerdy stuff so you don’t have to worry. And when it comes to specialty interiors like window treatments, we measure twice (even thrice) so everything fits impeccably. Lastly, Tangram stands by our installations. We offer maintenance guidance and can set up cleaning schedules or services to keep your floors and finishes looking new. And if down the line you decide to refresh or change out materials, we’ll be there to assist with minimal disruption. Walk on any floor we’ve installed and you’ll feel the difference – solidity, quality, and that intangible sense that every element of the space works together. That’s what we aim for. With Tangram, you’ll love where you stand.
Move Management & Facility Services (Service Page)
Smooth Moves and Stress-Free Spaces. Changing spaces or maintaining an office can be daunting – but not when Tangram is by your side. Our Move Management & Facility Services are designed to take the hassle out of relocations, office changes, and ongoing upkeep, so you can focus on your business while we handle the heavy lifting (literally!). Here’s how we support you at every stage of your workspace journey:
Strategic Move Planning: Moving an office is more than trucks and boxes; it’s a strategic project. Tangram’s move managers work with you to develop a detailed plan and timeline. We start weeks or months in advance, coordinating with building managers, IT teams, and any third parties. You’ll get a comprehensive move checklist and constant communication. Our goal is zero downtime for your operations.
Packing, Transport & Setup: Our trained crew will carefully pack your furniture, equipment, and contents (down to the last sticky note pad). We label and inventory everything for quick reassembly. On move day, we manage loading, transportation, unloading, and full setup at the new site. Your desks, chairs, and tech will be placed and assembled according to the floorplan – it’ll feel like you’ve worked there forever, from day one.
Internal Churn & Reconfiguration: Even if you’re not changing addresses, organizations evolve. Maybe you’re expanding to another floor, or reconfiguring your layout for a new team structure. We handle internal moves too – reassigning workstations, adding partitions, or consolidating departments. We work after hours or on weekends to minimize disruption, so come Monday, your people just sit in their new spots and get to work as usual.
Warehousing & Asset Management: Not sure what to do with excess furniture or files during a remodel or after downsizing? Tangram offers warehousing solutions in our secure facilities. We catalog your assets and can store them short- or long-term. When you need them again – or decide to liquidate or donate – we’ll manage that process. Think of it as a safety net for your furniture investments.
Facility Refresh & Maintenance: A space needs care to stay at its best. Our Facility Services cover things like furniture maintenance (tightening screws, fixing a wobbly desk leg), cleaning of specialty items (panels, upholstery), and coordinating repairs. Perhaps you need an office “reset” – deep cleaning, replacing a few worn pieces, touching up paint. We can arrange all of that. For companies without a full-time facility manager, we become your on-call support.
Decommissioning & Sustainability: When it’s time to leave a space or replace furniture, Tangram ensures the process is responsible. We handle decommissioning – removing furniture, making sure the space meets hand-back conditions – and we prioritize eco-friendly practices. Usable items can be donated to local nonprofits or recycled. We aim to minimize waste sent to landfill. It’s move-out with peace of mind.
Why use Tangram’s move and facility services? Because continuity and care matter. We know your space intimately from designing and furnishing it; who better to trust with moving or modifying it? Our integrated approach means we’re aware of all the little details – that that conference table only fits through a certain door at a certain angle, or that these specific desks need disassembly before transport. We plan accordingly, so surprises are eliminated. Moreover, we understand that an office move or change can be sensitive for employees. Our team acts with professionalism and courtesy – essentially becoming an extension of your team. We can even help with change management, advising how to communicate changes to staff and make the transition exciting (new space, yay!) rather than stressful. Clients often remark that partnering with Tangram for moves was the best decision they made – what could have been a logistical nightmare turned into a smooth operation, with every item in place and functioning at the new location in record time. And on the facilities side, having us in your back pocket is like an insurance policy for your workspace: whatever goes wrong, we’ll fix it, and whatever needs doing, we’ve got it handled. In short, we take care of your space so your team can take care of business. If a move or office change is on the horizon, let’s talk early and get a plan in motion. With Tangram’s Move & Facility Services, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without us. (Interested in a move? Check out our Moving Guide in the Insights section for tips, or contact us for a consultation – we’ll even help you decide if you need to move or can reconfigure your current space to meet your needs.)
Workplaces (Corporate Offices Market Page)
Innovative Workplaces for Modern Businesses. In today’s fast-paced corporate world, the office isn’t just a place to work – it’s a tool for driving culture, innovation, and growth. Tangram Interiors specializes in creating corporate workspaces that do exactly that. Whether you’re a bustling tech startup, a Fortune 500 headquarters, or a professional services firm, we design office environments that reflect your brand and empower your people. Imagine walking into an office that immediately tells your company’s story: your logo subtly integrated in the reception design, collaborative huddle spaces buzzing with energy, quiet nooks supporting focused tasks, and state-of-the-art meeting rooms connecting teams globally. We make this a reality by tailoring solutions to your unique workstyles and business objectives. Key features of our Workplace solutions:
Brand & Culture Integration: Your office should be uniquely yours. We infuse your company’s identity into the design – through color schemes, graphics, signage, and even custom furniture (thanks to our Studio Other). If innovation and agility define your culture, expect to see flexible layouts, writable surfaces filled with brainstorms, maybe even playful elements like a game area. If you value tradition and expertise, perhaps a blend of classic materials with modern comfort signals that. No two Tangram-designed offices look alike, because no two companies are alike.
Activity-Based Spaces: Gone are the days of rows of identical desks. We plan workplaces in zones that cater to different activities: open collaboration areas for team creativity, private enclaves or phone booths for focused work and calls, comfortable lounges for informal meetings or breaks, and adjustable workstations for individual tasks. This “activity-based working” approach means employees can choose the environment that best supports what they’re doing – leading to higher productivity and satisfaction.
Technology-Ready: Corporate offices thrive on connectivity. We make sure your spaces are technology rich: from plentiful power and data access at every seating area, to seamless AV in conference rooms, to future-proof infrastructure that can support IoT and whatever comes next. Need a touchdown space for remote workers when they visit? We’ll integrate plug-and-play kiosks. Considering sensors to monitor space utilization? We can plan for that too. Your smart office ambitions are ours to execute.
Wellness & Comfort: Happy, healthy employees are more engaged and productive. Tangram incorporates wellness features – ergonomic seating and desk setups for every employee, proper lighting (with options for circadian rhythm-supporting fixtures), biophilic elements like plants or natural materials for a soothing vibe, and ample access to daylight and views. We can also advise on WELL Building standards or other wellness certifications if that’s a goal. Little touches like relaxation rooms or wellness rooms for new moms can make a big difference in a corporate environment, and we plan for them.
Scalability and Flexibility: Businesses change. We design offices that can adapt with minimal fuss. Modular furniture systems, demountable walls, reconfigurable layouts – these allow you to scale up, pivot your teams, or even sub-divide or expand spaces as needed. Today’s innovation lab could be tomorrow’s new department zone. With Tangram’s foresight in design, your workplace will be ready for whatever the future holds.
Our Experience: Tangram has transformed corporate interiors for a wide array of industries – tech, entertainment, finance, legal, retail headquarters, and more. We understand the nuances: a law firm might prioritize confidentiality and classic elegance, a tech firm might seek open collaboration and bold creativity, a media company might need specialized studios or screening rooms. We bring deep knowledge of best practices in each case, coupled with an outside-the-box design approach. The result? Workplaces that don’t just meet functional needs, but actually drive better outcomes. Picture employees actually excited to come into the office because it’s a space that energizes and supports them. Picture clients or recruits walking through your space and immediately getting a sense of your professionalism and culture – and being impressed. That’s the power of a Tangram-designed workplace. It’s not just an address; it’s a competitive advantage. If you’re ready to elevate your corporate office into a destination that attracts talent and accelerates success, we’re here to help make it happen. Let’s work together to create the workplace of your dreams – and your employees’ dreams.

Healthcare (Market Page)
Healing Environments that Put People First. In healthcare, the design of space can directly impact patient outcomes, staff efficiency, and overall wellbeing. Tangram Interiors understands the unique challenges and critical importance of healthcare environments – from bustling hospitals to intimate clinics. Our approach balances the strict requirements of healthcare (cleanability, safety, functionality) with the compassion and calm that patients and caregivers need. We create healthcare spaces that are welcoming and highly efficient, because we know these aren’t just workplaces – they’re healing places. What we bring to healthcare projects:
Patient-Centered Design: The patient journey is at the heart of our planning. In waiting areas, we provide comfortable, soothing furniture arrangements that reduce stress – with options for family groups to sit together, or private nooks for quiet reflection. Colors and materials are chosen for their calming influence. In exam rooms, we seek to humanize the space: ergonomic seating for patients and family, convenient surfaces for personal items, and layouts that foster eye-level conversation between patient and caregiver (no one wants to talk to a doctor who has their back turned to a computer – we address that!).
Clinical Efficiency: For staff work areas – nurse stations, charting alcoves, labs – we design for optimal workflow. Our solutions include modular casework and mobile carts so supplies and tools are always within reach. We use healthcare-grade furnishings that stand up to intensive use and rigorous cleaning protocols. And we pay attention to sightlines and lighting, ensuring caregivers have clear visibility to patients and ample illumination for detailed tasks without causing glare or discomfort.
Clean, Safe Materials: Healthcare demands stringent cleanliness. Tangram specifies materials that are antimicrobial, easy to clean, and durable against harsh cleaners. From vinyl upholstery on chairs, to solid-surface tops that don’t trap bacteria, to flooring that prevents slips and is seamless for infection control – every selection is made with safety in mind. We also consider accessibility and inclusivity, adhering to ADA guidelines so all patients feel accommodated.
Healthcare Technology Integration: Modern healthcare spaces are tech-heavy – and we make it seamless. Whether integrating boom arms and mounts for monitors in exam rooms, telemedicine stations in clinics, or routing power and data to vital equipment in patient rooms, we ensure the furniture and walls support all necessary medical devices. We also incorporate things like charging stations in waiting areas, electronic patient check-in kiosks, and even relaxation tech (like video screens with nature scenes) in infusion bays, as the project requires.
Comfort for Caregivers: Burnout is a real challenge in healthcare. We believe the environment should care for the caregivers too. Our designs include staff respite areas – comfy break rooms or outdoor patios where hardworking medical staff can recharge. We select ergonomic seating and height-adjustable workstations for nurses and doctors, because long shifts demand physical support. By designing with caregivers in mind, we help improve morale and retention, which ultimately benefits patient care.
From Hospitals to Wellness Clinics: Tangram’s portfolio spans large-scale hospitals, outpatient clinics, dental and physician offices, senior living facilities, and wellness centers. Each type of space has nuances. For example, in pediatrics we incorporate cheerful, playful elements to put kids at ease (imagine a colorful wall graphic or kid-sized furniture in waiting rooms). In senior living, we blend residential coziness with healthcare functionality (like beautiful dining furniture that also accommodates mobility devices). We tailor solutions to each setting’s patient population and care model. One constant is our empathy-driven approach. We often step into the shoes of a patient or a nurse and walk through the space in our mind: Is this chair comfortable for a potentially anxious patient? Does this room layout maintain dignity and privacy? Can staff easily do their job without extra steps? By asking these questions, we arrive at designs that genuinely improve the healthcare experience. Healing and hope – built into the environment. That’s what we strive for. We’re proud that our healthcare designs have helped hospitals increase patient satisfaction scores and made clinicians’ workdays a little easier. When families feel at home in a waiting room or a nurse can do rounds more smoothly, we know the design is doing its job. If you’re looking to renovate or build a healthcare space that truly cares for all who enter, Tangram is ready to be your partner. Together, let’s create spaces that are the embodiment of “care.”
Higher Education (Market Page)
Inspiring Spaces for Higher Learning. Universities and colleges are hubs of innovation, collaboration, and discovery – they need spaces that keep up with the energy and curiosity of students and faculty. Tangram Interiors specializes in designing higher education environments that enhance learning outcomes and campus life. From active classrooms to advanced research labs, cozy libraries to vibrant student centers, we craft spaces that help minds grow. Our approach to higher ed design:
Active Learning Classrooms: Today’s pedagogy has moved beyond lecture-only. We design classrooms that easily switch between lecture, discussion, and group work. This might include mobile tables and chairs that can rearrange on the fly, integrated technology like interactive displays or lecture capture cameras, and ample whiteboard surfaces around the room so students can engage from any seat. Tangram’s furniture solutions for classrooms emphasize flexibility and durability – ready for whatever learning activity is on the agenda (and able to withstand years of use by enthusiastic learners).
Collaborative Commons: Students do a lot of learning outside the classroom too. We help institutions create collaboration zones, study lounges, and commons areas that attract students to stay on campus and work together. Picture comfortable couches and booths with built-in charging ports, movable whiteboards for brainstorming, and semi-private pods where small groups can huddle without reserving a formal room. These environments often become the heart of a department or library – buzzing with academic dialogue and teamwork.
Cutting-Edge Labs and Studios: For specialized disciplines – engineering, science, design, technology – we provide tailored solutions. This could mean modular lab benches and ergonomic stools for a chemistry lab, makerspace furniture that adapts to different projects, or easels and storage for an art studio. We also handle technical needs like ventilation accommodations for lab equipment, or specific lighting for media editing suites. By combining form and function, we ensure these spaces empower students to push boundaries in their fields.
Libraries & Learning Resource Centers: The modern library is as much about collaboration and creation as it is about quiet study. Tangram designs library interiors that balance both. We carve out silent study zones with carrels or acoustic panels for focus, alongside group study rooms equipped with screens for joint work. We’ve outfitted libraries with everything from moveable bookcases to make space for events, to café-style seating areas that encourage impromptu discussions. And of course, comfortable chairs everywhere – because a long study session shouldn’t be a pain.
Student Life & Informal Spaces: A vibrant campus life requires great informal spaces – lounges, cafés, lobbies, residence hall common areas. We bring hospitality flair to these, selecting durable yet stylish furniture that invites relaxation and socializing. Think mix-and-match seating for a student union lobby that can host a club fair one day and a gaming tournament the next. Or versatile furniture in residence hall lounges that feels like a homey living room for students. We aim to make students feel welcome and at ease, strengthening the campus community.
Designing for Adaptability: Higher education faces continual change – shifting enrollment numbers, new programs, evolving technology. Our designs prioritize adaptability. Many of our higher ed clients love demountable walls in administrative offices or advising centers, so they can reconfigure as departments grow. And furniture that can be re-used or re-zoned when buildings get repurposed (for instance, if an old library becomes a student success center, much of the lounge furniture and tables can move and still fit in). Why Tangram for Higher Ed? We speak the language of stakeholders across campus. We know professors want classrooms that “just work” without 10 minutes of setup fuss. We know facility managers need solutions that are budget-conscious and long-lasting. We know designers and campus planners seek cohesive aesthetics that align with campus identity. We bring all these perspectives together, plus our knowledge of educational trends and student preferences (yes, we do our homework on Gen Z and Millennial study habits!). From Pac-12 universities to local community colleges, Tangram has enriched campuses with spaces that engage and delight. Our higher ed projects often become selling points in recruitment – a well-designed learning environment signals to prospective students that the institution cares about their success. Bottom line: We create campus spaces that work as hard as the students and faculty using them. Let’s transform your campus together, making it a place where innovation lives and students thrive. (For examples, see our Projects section – like the state-of-the-art innovation hub we furnished at a leading university. And don’t miss our Insight article on “Designing for Gen Z Learners” for more ideas.)
K-12 Education (Market Page)
Transforming K-12 Learning Environments. The classrooms of today are incubators for the leaders of tomorrow – and they need to inspire, engage, and adapt to new ways of learning. Tangram Interiors is passionate about K-12 education design. We work with schools (public, private, charter alike) to create vibrant, flexible learning spaces from kindergarten to high school that support teachers and ignite students’ love of learning. In a Tangram-designed K-12 space, gone are rows of static desks facing a chalkboard. Instead, you’ll see:
Flexible Classrooms: We provide student desks and tables that are easily movable (often on casters) so teachers can quickly switch between lecture mode, group project clusters, or a big circle for class discussions. Seating might include traditional chairs mixed with soft ottomans or standing-height options to let fidgety kids move a bit. Writable surfaces abound – maybe one entire wall is a whiteboard or tackable surface where students can display work. By making classrooms flexible, we empower educators with endless ways to configure their space for different activities and learning styles.
Interactive & Tech-Enabled: Today’s learners are digital natives. We ensure classrooms and media labs are tech-ready – integrating smart boards or interactive displays that replace old projectors, providing charging stations for tablets or laptops, and arranging furniture to avoid glare and give clear sightlines to screens. We can even incorporate fun tech like augmented reality sandboxes or coding robot play zones for STEM classes, working those into the overall layout seamlessly. The environment will encourage students to engage with technology collaboratively and responsibly.
Collaborative Zones & Commons: Learning isn’t confined to the classroom. Tangram helps schools create breakout spaces in corridors or dedicated collaboration areas in libraries and media centers. Picture a “learning commons” with colorful couches, low tables, and markerboard partitions where a small group can gather to brainstorm. Or a quiet corner with comfortable lounge chairs for individual reading. These spaces can also serve multiple purposes – a commons might double as an informal tutoring spot after school or a place for parent meetings. Versatility is key.
Specialty Rooms: Think art rooms, science labs, libraries, makerspaces. We design each to be age-appropriate and inspiring. In an early childhood art room, that might mean low tables, easy-to-clean surfaces, and lots of storage bins within kid reach. In a high school physics lab, perhaps height-adjustable lab stations, safe chemical storage, and stools designed for long lab periods. Libraries transform into media centers with a mix of bookshelves, digital research stations, and comfy nooks to encourage a love of reading. Our design for each space aligns with curriculum needs and safety standards – for example, our science furniture is chemical-resistant and our makerspace setups include safe tool storage.
Furniture for Growth & Movement: Kids grow – sometimes fast! We recommend furniture that can adjust or accomodate various sizes, so you get longevity out of your investment (like chairs that fit 5th graders but also work for 8th graders). Recognizing the importance of movement in learning, we often include options like standing desks or wobble stools that let students burn off energy and improve focus. These have been popular for kinesthetic learners and are easily incorporated into classroom sets.
School Spirit & Well-being: We love infusing school colors or mascots subtly into the design to boost spirit – maybe the media center has chairs in the school’s palette, or a custom graphic of the mascot adorns a wall in the gym lobby. And because schools need to be safe havens, we consider lines of sight for supervision, easy-to-clean materials for hygiene, and layouts that avoid clutter. Our designs can also contribute to social-emotional learning by providing calming areas (maybe a soft beanbag corner for cool-down time in an elementary classroom, or a wellness room for stressed teens to decompress in high school). Durability is Non-Negotiable: We know hundreds of energetic kids will put any space to the test. So, Tangram selects sturdy, education-grade furniture and flooring that can withstand the scuffs, spills, and enthusiastic use that come with the territory. We consider maintenance too – surfaces that won’t trap gum or graffiti, fabrics that are stain-resistant, and chairs that can stack or flip up for easy room cleaning. Tangram has partnered with K-12 districts to modernize aging schools as well as to outfit brand-new campus buildings. In every case, we involve teachers and administrators in the conversation, because their insights ensure the space truly supports their pedagogical goals. The result of a well-designed learning environment is tangible: students who are more engaged, teachers who have more effective classroom management, and a school culture that celebrates collaboration and creativity. We’re humbled to play a part in shaping the spaces that shape young minds. If your school or district is looking to reimagine its learning spaces, let’s talk. Together, we can create classrooms and campuses that are as dynamic and promising as the students who fill them.
Hospitality Spaces (Market Page)
Where Design Meets Experience – Hospitality Environments. Tangram’s expertise isn’t limited to offices and schools; we also bring our design acumen to hospitality spaces – hotels, restaurants, lounges, and entertainment venues. In these environments, guest experience is king. It’s about creating a vibe, telling a story, and ensuring comfort all at once. Our team knows how to deliver the “WOW” factor that keeps guests coming back, while also addressing the practical needs of operators. What we offer in Hospitality design:
Boutique Hotel Chic: From lobby to guest room to rooftop bar, we furnish and finish hospitality spaces that make a statement. Your lobby, for instance, isn’t just a waiting area – it’s the first impression and a social hub. We might create intimate seating clusters with plush chairs and artistic side tables that invite conversation. Bold lighting fixtures become focal points. The front desk could be a custom piece from our Studio Other, echoing local culture or the hotel’s theme. For guest rooms, we source and install everything from the bed frames and mattresses (ergonomic and durable for commercial use) to stylish desks and cozy armchairs. We emphasize a residential-meets-luxury feel so guests feel pampered, yet at home.
Restaurants & Bars: Ambiance sets the appetite. We design dining spaces that are functional for service and delightful for diners. That means considering flow for waitstaff, choosing fabrics that are both elegant and cleanable, and integrating banquettes or bar stools that remain comfortable through a leisurely meal or late-night drink. Whether it’s a fast-casual eatery needing sturdy, space-efficient furniture or a high-end restaurant desiring bespoke wine storage displays and upholstered seating, Tangram curates pieces that align with the culinary concept and aesthetics. We also pay attention to acoustics (diners should enjoy buzz, not noise) and lighting (versatile lighting levels for daytime vs. evening moods).
Experience-Driven Venues: For entertainment venues, be it a trendy co-working lounge, an event space, or a theater lobby, we design with the guest journey in mind. This might involve flexible furniture that can be reconfigured for different events, durable finishes for high traffic, and Instagram-worthy corners that become part of the marketing (everyone loves a cool backdrop). We often integrate technology here too – perhaps charging stations in a lounge, or interactive kiosks for self-service check-in at a venue. Our goal is to enhance the guest’s convenience and enjoyment at every turn.
Outdoor & Rooftop Spaces: In hospitality, outdoors is as important as indoors. Tangram supplies quality outdoor furniture for patios, courtyards, and rooftop decks that can withstand the elements while looking fabulous. Think chic cabanas and loungers by the hotel pool, communal fire-pit seating for an evening cocktail lounge, or cafe tables with umbrellas for an al fresco dining terrace. We ensure the style flows from inside out, creating a seamless experience.
Branded Storytelling: Hospitality is all about storytelling – why does your space exist and what makes it unique? We love to incorporate thematic or local elements. For example, for a hotel in a historic district, we might include vintage-inspired pieces or art that nods to local history. For a cutting-edge urban hotel, maybe minimalist furnishings with pops of bold color to exude modern flair. Our custom capabilities via Studio Other allow us to create signature installations (like a reception backdrop or a sculpture) that become synonymous with your brand.
Efficiency & Function: Behind the scenes of hospitality, operations matter. We account for that by selecting furniture that’s stackable or easily stored for event spaces, fabrics that meet fire codes and can be cleaned daily, and modular solutions that allow for quick refreshes. Our designs subtly integrate necessities like wayfinding signage, luggage storage areas, or buffet credenzas, so they fit the design scheme while serving their purpose. Tangram’s experience in hospitality includes boutique hotels in trendsetting neighborhoods, corporate conference centers requiring a touch of hospitality comfort, and even upscale senior living facilities that blur the line with resort living. We adapt to the level of service and style needed, always with an eye on durability – because we know hospitality furnishings see a lot of love (and occasionally, spills). Ultimately, hospitality design is successful when guests feel transformed by the space – be it relaxed, energized, or indulged – and when the operator finds the space easy to maintain and versatile for their business needs. That is the balance we strike. If you want to create a destination that leaves a lasting impression on your guests, Tangram is ready to collaborate. We’ll bring the furnishings, finishes, and flair; you bring the vision of the experience you want to create. Together, we’ll make every visitor’s stay a memorable one.
Government & Public Sector (Market Page)
Efficient, Civic-Minded Spaces for Government. Public sector environments have a unique mandate – they must serve the community effectively, withstand heavy use, and often operate under tight budgets and regulations. Tangram Interiors has a wealth of experience designing government offices and civic spaces that meet these demands while creating a pleasant atmosphere for employees and citizens alike. We believe government workplaces can be both highly functional and inviting, projecting an image of transparency and service. Our approach to public sector projects includes:
Durability & Functionality: Government facilities – whether it’s a city hall, a DMV office, or a federal agency headquarters – see a lot of traffic. We choose furnishings and materials that are robust and easy to maintain. Sturdy seating that can accommodate a range of body types and is built to last, counters and desks that resist scratches, and flooring that holds up to years of footfall. Our solutions also consider security and safety (e.g., secure reception desks with bullet-resistant panels where needed, easy-to-clean finishes for public health).
Welcoming Public Interface: When citizens enter a government building, the environment should be welcoming and user-friendly. We design reception areas and lobbies with clear signage, comfortable waiting furniture, and often a bit of civic pride – perhaps featuring local art or imagery that resonates with the community. Seating is arranged to be accessible for the elderly or those with disabilities, and we ensure layouts meet ADA requirements thoroughly. By making public-facing areas less intimidating and more accommodating, we help improve the overall citizen experience.
Efficient Workspaces for Staff: Government offices require layouts that maximize efficiency and communication among teams. We often implement open-plan systems or semi-private cubicles that balance the need for individual focus with collaboration. Given hierarchical structures, we might provide private offices for certain roles but with glass fronts to encourage openness. Storage is typically a big need (records, files, equipment), so we incorporate ample storage solutions – everything from high-density filing systems to secure cabinets for sensitive documents. Our designs streamline workflows, helping civil servants do their jobs effectively, which in turn benefits the public.
Council Chambers & Meeting Rooms: For civic meeting spaces like council chambers, courtrooms, or community meeting rooms, we ensure the furniture and layout facilitate clear communication and fairness. This could mean tiered seating or dais designs for visibility, integrated microphone and A/V systems for public address, and durable yet dignified finishes (wood tones, etc.) that convey respect for the proceedings. Flexible seating that can handle overflow crowds or be reconfigured for different event types is also a consideration.
Budget-Conscious Solutions: We understand public projects have fiduciary responsibility. Tangram leverages our broad supplier network to find cost-effective solutions that don’t compromise on quality. We can often suggest value-engineered options – for instance, a less costly material that looks similar to a premium one, or reusing and refurbishing some of your existing furniture to stretch dollars. We’ll help prioritize where to invest for impact (like ergonomic chairs for staff to reduce fatigue, or durable flooring in high-traffic areas) and where to save.
Sustainability and Compliance: Government entities frequently have mandates for sustainability and local procurement. Tangram is experienced in specifying products that meet LEED criteria, low VOC paints and finishes, and furniture from manufacturers who participate in environmental programs. We also ensure our solutions comply with GSA standards or other governmental purchasing requirements, making the procurement process smoother for you. Case in point: We helped redesign a county services center, introducing a more open layout that broke down silos between departments – resulting in shorter lines and happier citizens because tasks got done faster in one trip. We furnished a state office building with modern systems furniture that updated a 30-year-old interior into a space that attracted younger talent to public service (sometimes the environment does influence recruitment!). From federal to local, our guiding principle is to reinforce the notion that government spaces can be caring, efficient, and forward-thinking. By improving the workplace for public employees, we indirectly improve services for the public. And by making civic spaces more inviting, we strengthen community trust and engagement. Tangram would be honored to partner on your next public sector project – bringing our private-sector design savvy and tailoring it to the public realm’s needs. Together, let’s create spaces that uphold and celebrate the important work you do for the community.

What You’ll Find in Each Case Study:
For every project, we share a glimpse into the client’s goals, the challenges we tackled, and the outcome achieved. You’ll see before-and-after photos, design renderings, and of course, the final installed space in all its glory. We also highlight key products and custom elements used, giving credit to the partners and manufacturers who helped bring the vision to life. Perhaps you’re interested in how a space similar to yours turned out. Use the filters or search bar: type “biotech lab” or select “Higher Education” to find relevant examples. Each case study is meant to not only exhibit our work but also spark ideas for your own project. As you explore, notice the diversity: a sleek tech office looks very different from a warm healthcare clinic or a vibrant elementary school – and that’s exactly our intention. Tangram doesn’t do one-size-fits-all design; we pride ourselves on tailoring each project to the client’s identity and needs. Our portfolio reflects that range. Results that Matter: We’re especially proud when clients share measurable successes post-occupancy. In some project descriptions, you’ll read quotes or stats – like how employee satisfaction jumped 20% in the new space, or how a college saw increased usage of their library after our redesign. These outcomes drive us and validate the power of thoughtful design. Take your time and enjoy the tour of Tangram’s world. If something catches your eye or you have questions about how we achieved a certain look or solved a particular problem, don’t hesitate to reach out. Every project here started with a conversation, and we’d love to have one with you about your goals. Inspired to start your own success story? After soaking in the possibilities, head over to our Contact page or drop a note to our team. Let’s create a space that will feature in this gallery in the future – your transformed space, realized by Tangram.

Client Portal (Login Page)
Tangram Client Portal – Your Project, at Your Fingertips. Welcome to our secure Client Portal, a personalized online space where you can stay up-to-date on all the details of your project with us. If you’re a Tangram client with an active project, log in below to access real-time information and collaborative tools:
Project Dashboard: See an overview of progress – upcoming milestones, recent activities, and overall timeline status. Know exactly what phase your project is in (design, ordering, installation, etc.) without having to send an email or pick up the phone.
Documents & Drawings: All your important files in one place. Floor plans, 3D renderings, furniture specifications, quotes, and contracts – whatever documents we’ve prepared for you – are available for viewing and download. No more digging through emails to find that latest layout PDF; it’s here in the portal library, always up-to-date with the most recent versions.
Communication Hub: Have a question or need to request a change? You can message your Tangram project team right in the portal. We’ll respond here, keeping all communications organized by topic. You can also find notes from meetings or call summaries posted for your reference. It’s a transparent log of our ongoing dialogue.
Task & Approval Center: Occasionally, we’ll need your input – say, approving a fabric selection or confirming a delivery date. The portal will highlight any pending approvals or decisions awaiting your review. You can easily approve or comment with a click. It keeps the project moving swiftly, even between scheduled meetings.
Installation Tracker: When it’s time for delivery and installation, watch the progress live! The portal will show which furniture shipments are en route, installation schedules, and completion status of different areas. Imagine seeing “Conference Room A – Installed ✔️” pop up, giving you peace of mind that things are on track.
Post-Project Support: After the project wraps up, the portal remains a resource. Need to report a warranty issue or request an additional item? Submit a service ticket here and our facility service team will coordinate the fix. You can also access maintenance guides for your new furniture and finishes – helping you care for your space long after move-in.
