# AI-Enhanced Webflow ‚Üí Sanity Migration

This advanced migration system uses AI to analyze, improve, and optimize your Webflow content before importing it into Sanity. Instead of bulk importing raw data, we create high-quality, professionally enhanced content.

## üéØ What This System Does

### Content Enhancement
- **Text Improvement**: Refines writing for professional tone and brand consistency
- **SEO Optimization**: Generates meta descriptions and tags for better search visibility
- **Missing Content**: Creates compelling descriptions, bios, and alt text where missing
- **Brand Alignment**: Ensures all content matches Tangram's sophisticated, design-focused voice

### Image Intelligence
- **Visual Analysis**: Uses GPT-4 Vision to identify furniture, design styles, and color palettes
- **Metadata Generation**: Creates descriptive alt text and categorization tags
- **Asset Optimization**: Proper image handling and Sanity asset management
- **Accessibility**: Ensures all images have meaningful descriptions

### Quality Control
- **Content Scoring**: Tracks enhancement quality and completion
- **Progress Logging**: Detailed logs of all AI improvements made
- **Fallback Safety**: Original content preserved if AI enhancement fails
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Smart checking to avoid reimporting existing content

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install OpenAI SDK if not already installed
cd apps/corporate-frontend
npm install openai

# Ensure environment variables are set
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key" >> .env.local
echo "WEBFLOW_API_TOKEN=your_webflow_token" >> .env.local
echo "WEBFLOW_SITE_ID=your_site_id" >> .env.local
echo "SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_sanity_token" >> .env.local
```

### 1. Analysis Phase (Recommended First Step)
```bash
# Analyze your Webflow content to see enhancement opportunities
node ai-enhanced-migration.js analyze
```

This will generate a detailed report showing:
- Content quality scores for each collection
- Enhancement potential percentages
- Specific recommendations for AI improvements
- Before/after improvement projections

### 2. Test Migration (Single Collection)
```bash
# Migrate just projects first to test the system
node ai-enhanced-migration.js projects

# Or migrate just team members
node ai-enhanced-migration.js team
```

### 3. Full Migration
```bash
# Migrate everything with AI enhancement
node ai-enhanced-migration.js all
```
