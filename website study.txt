Brand Strengths and Current Site Highlights
Tangram Interiors presents itself as a trusted industry leader with decades of experience, evidenced by its founding in the 1960s and growth to a top-tier dealership in the U.S.
tangraminteriors.com
. The current website’s content underscores a mission of integrating people, technology, and place in “transformative spaces”
tangraminteriors.com
. This holistic positioning is a key strength – Tangram isn’t just selling furniture, it’s conveying a vision of cohesive, experience-driven workspace solutions. The brand voice comes across as collaborative and innovative, emphasizing that great design “shapes behaviors, boosts well-being, and increases productivity”

. This warm, human-centered tone helps establish trust and approachability, appealing to decision-makers who seek not only products but a creative partner. Another strength is the breadth of Tangram’s capabilities and content on the site. Tangram has evolved into a one-stop solution for interiors, which the current site reflects through sections on multiple service lines and market segments. The site highlights five integrated business units

 that complement its core furniture offerings, positioning Tangram as an end-to-end provider. These include:
Contract Furniture – workspace furniture solutions leveraging top brands and bespoke options

.
Tangram also showcases expertise across key markets, each with targeted messaging. The site’s “Markets” pages address sectors like Workplace, Healthcare, Higher Education, and K-12 Education
tangraminteriors.com
, speaking directly to the needs of those environments (e.g. “Elevate Your Workspace” for corporate, or “Transforming K-12 Learning Environments” for schools). This structured approach helps visitors quickly find content relevant to their industry, a valuable asset for engaging diverse client verticals. Content-wise, the current website provides rich storytelling in project case studies and thought leadership. The Projects section (e.g. recent project features) goes beyond galleries, offering narrative overviews, goals, solutions, and results for each project
tangraminteriors.com
tangraminteriors.com
. This depth is a strength, as it frames Tangram’s work as case studies with context and impact – demonstrating how Tangram addresses client objectives and the human outcomes of each space (enhanced collaboration, innovation, etc.). For instance, one project narrative describes Tangram’s “human-centered design ethos” delivering a workplace that’s “high-performing and deeply inspiring.”
tangraminteriors.com
 Such storytelling showcases Tangram’s expertise and the value of its designs, which is compelling for a design-minded audience. Furthermore, Tangram’s site stays active and current. A News & Publications section shares company updates and profiles (e.g. leadership appointments, employee spotlights, and insights) with recent dates
tangraminteriors.com
. This fresh content suggests an ongoing engagement with trends and community, reinforcing Tangram’s credibility and thought leadership. The brand also highlights important values such as being a women-owned business and a champion of diversity and inclusion, which can differentiate Tangram in the marketplace
tangraminteriors.com
. Visually, the site likely incorporates professional photography of Tangram’s projects and showrooms, giving visitors a glimpse of the quality and style Tangram delivers. The use of real project imagery alongside content is a strength that lends authenticity and inspiration. In summary, Tangram Interiors’ current website effectively communicates its experience, comprehensive services, and collaborative philosophy. The brand positioning is clear: Tangram is a creative partner that “brings brands to life” through innovative workspaces
tangraminteriors.com
. Its strengths lie in rich content (case studies, market-specific info, news updates) and a warm, knowledgeable tone that is reassuring to clients in corporate, education, healthcare and beyond.
Visual & Experiential Gaps in the Current Site
Despite solid content and messaging, the current Tangram site has visual and experiential shortcomings that present opportunities for improvement. One notable gap is the site’s visual impact and immersiveness. While it features quality images, the design layout appears somewhat conventional and template-driven. For example, content often sits in constrained containers, and there is limited use of full-width imagery or interactive media to truly immerse the visitor in Tangram’s environments. Given Tangram’s work is highly visual (beautiful offices, schools, and collaborative spaces), the site could do more to showcase these spaces in a bold, expansive way. The lack of full-bleed sections, panoramic images, or video content means the user experience currently leans heavily on text and static photos. A more spatially immersive design (with edge-to-edge project imagery, perhaps subtle motion or 360° views) could better convey the feeling of stepping into a Tangram-designed space. Another gap is in the overall user experience and navigation flow. The current navigation is quite extensive (with separate sections for About, Projects, Services, Markets, News, etc.), which can feel siloed. A visitor must click through multiple menu items to piece together Tangram’s full story. This structure, while comprehensive, might be overwhelming or not as streamlined for storytelling. For instance, the separation of “Projects” and “Markets” means a user interested in, say, healthcare might not immediately see healthcare-specific case studies without navigating between sections. The site could benefit from a more consolidated or guided journey, where users can naturally discover relevant projects, products, and insights within their area of interest, rather than jumping around. Currently, the content is there, but the storytelling path is not as cohesive as it could be. Moreover, interactivity and modern web features are underutilized. The site appears to rely on static layouts with minimal interactive elements beyond basic image galleries. There’s an opportunity to introduce more engaging features – for example, interactive timelines of Tangram’s history (to highlight that legacy since 1963), before-and-after sliders for renovation projects, or scroll-triggered animations that reveal key messages in an eye-catching way. The existing site has solid copy (e.g. project goals and results) but these stories could be brought to life visually. Without modern interactive design, Tangram’s digital presence may not fully reflect the innovative, cutting-edge nature of its real-world designs. In short, the experience of the website currently lags behind the experience one has in a Tangram interior space. Aligning those two – making the website feel as dynamic and inspiring as the environments Tangram creates – is a clear area for growth. Finally, content discoverability can be improved. Tangram has great content (projects, articles, product info in text form), but a visitor might not easily stumble upon, say, a curated inspiration article or a specific product line without digging. There is no obvious “Inspiration” hub or gallery of ideas, and the product information is not presented in a structured, browsable way. Given Tangram’s role as a dealer for many products, the site currently lacks a product discovery experience – a gap for users who might want to explore furniture and solutions on their own before contacting sales. Additionally, lead generation elements (like clear calls-to-action or inquiry forms targeted to specific services/verticals) are relatively basic. A generic “Get in Touch” exists, but the site could better nurture potential clients by guiding them – for example, a “Plan my workspace” consultation form or tailored CTAs on sector pages (“Contact our Education Design Team”, etc.). In sum, the current site could do more to engage visitors actively – inviting them to explore and connect – rather than functioning as a static information repository.
Digital Storytelling Opportunities
Building on the identified gaps, there are significant opportunities to inject digital storytelling into Tangram’s web presence. Tangram’s rich narrative content (the challenges and successes of each project, the ethos of their brand, the people behind the work) can be amplified through creative web storytelling techniques. One opportunity is to develop the case studies into more compelling immersive stories. Instead of a basic project page with text and images, imagine a scrolling experience where the project unfolds like a story: starting with a bold hero image of the finished space, followed by sections that flow into the client’s vision and goals, the design process, and interactive highlights (e.g. clickable hotspots on a floorplan or a short video clip of the space in use). Tangram already writes project goals and outcomes in a narrative way
tangraminteriors.com
tangraminteriors.com
; the opportunity is to present that narrative with equal creativity digitally – using visuals, motion, and perhaps voice or video testimony from the clients or designers. By doing so, each case study becomes a showcase piece that not only prospective clients read, but experience. Another storytelling opportunity lies in creating an “Inspiration” or “Ideas” section that goes beyond project specifics. Tangram can leverage its expertise and thought leadership by curating content such as “workspace trends”, “designer’s picks”, or interactive lookbooks of innovative spaces. For example, a feature could be “Spaces We Love” highlighting Tangram’s favorite project moments or global design inspiration, with big photographs and commentary – positioning Tangram as a curator of great design, not just a vendor. This kind of content marketing engages design-minded visitors (like architects or design-savvy executives) by providing value and inspiration, subtly reinforcing Tangram’s authority in the field. It transforms the site from a company brochure into a digital magazine for workspace design. Storytelling here isn’t about one project, but about Tangram’s perspective on creating better environments (for work, learning, healing, etc.). It humanizes the brand by sharing insights, not just products. There’s also an opportunity to tell Tangram’s own story more dynamically. The About page currently conveys the mission and values in text form
tangraminteriors.com
. This could be enriched with a timeline of Tangram’s history (showing evolution since 1964, milestones, and innovations over time), or an interactive map of Tangram’s impact (highlighting major projects across regions or the communities they serve). Incorporating mini-stories about Tangram’s team (for instance, spotlighting a designer’s approach or a day-in-the-life at Tangram studio) would add a personal, human touch. This aligns with a warm tone and shows prospective clients the people and passion behind the brand. Even something like a short welcome video from leadership or a montage of Tangram’s team collaborating could set a confident yet inviting tone. All these storytelling elements ensure the website isn’t just telling visitors about Tangram – it’s showing them narratives that they can connect with emotionally. In leveraging these opportunities, Tangram’s website can evolve into a platform that inspires, educates, and engages. By prioritizing narrative and experience – not just listing services or products – the site will resonate more with visitors. The goal is for potential clients to not only understand what Tangram does, but to feel the possibilities Tangram can unlock for their own spaces. In summary, digital storytelling will allow Tangram Interiors to demonstrate its value in a compelling, human-centered way – through immersive case studies, creative content hubs, and authentic brand stories – ultimately forging a stronger connection with the design-minded audience.
Proposed Design Direction: Modern, Immersive & Human-Centered
Visual Design & Aesthetic
The new Tangram Interiors website should embrace a full-width, spatially immersive design that immediately captivates visitors. Visually, this means a departure from constrained layouts to a more expansive, edge-to-edge presentation that mirrors the experience of walking into a stunning Tangram-designed space. The design will leverage large-format imagery and possibly video: for example, a sweeping hero banner might depict a beautifully furnished office lobby or collaborative classroom in rich detail, spanning the entire screen to draw users in. Throughout the site, high-resolution photographs of Tangram’s projects will take center stage, with layouts that allow content to breathe – ample white space and full-bleed sections will create a modern, gallery-like feel. This approach aligns with Tangram’s creative industry; it gives the website a “design magazine” vibe, appropriate for an audience that appreciates aesthetics and innovation. In terms of style, the direction remains clean and contemporary, but with warm, humanizing touches. Tangram’s brand colors and identity will be refined and consistently applied – likely a neutral, sophisticated palette (whites, grays, charcoal) with an accent color that could echo the Tangram logo or a vibrant hue from their interior designs. Typography will be bold yet elegant: using modern sans-serif fonts for a crisp look, paired with maybe a lighter or italic style for subtexts to add warmth. Headlines can be set in confident, larger type conveying Tangram’s bold vision, while body text remains highly legible. Interactive elements (buttons, links, hover states) should be sleek, perhaps with subtle micro-animations like an underline that slides in, reinforcing a polished feel. We will also integrate subtle animation and motion design for engagement – for instance, as the user scrolls, images might fade or slide gracefully into view, or a background video might play silently to showcase a bustling workspace. These details add a sense of dynamism and modernity, signaling that Tangram is on the cutting edge of design. Crucially, the visual design will also evoke warmth and approachability. While the layout is modern, we’ll incorporate imagery of people and natural elements to avoid a cold, overly formal look. Photographs could show people interacting in Tangram’s spaces – a team huddled in a collaborative area, students using a Tangram-furnished classroom – to highlight the human element. The color accents might be warm tones (for example, a touch of orange or a calm blue) to complement the neutral base, creating an inviting atmosphere. We can also weave in subtle graphic motifs inspired by the tangram puzzle – geometric shapes or patterns that appear in backgrounds or as dividers, which nod to the brand name and the idea of pieces coming together to form a whole. These should be used sparingly and artfully (for example, a faint overlay of geometric shapes on a header or in the footer) to add uniqueness without distraction. Overall, the aesthetic goal is a balance of sleek and human: Tangram’s site should look as professionally designed as the top architecture firms’ websites, but feel warmer and more personal, reflecting Tangram’s welcoming culture.
Experience Strategy & Content
The proposed experience strategy centers on clarity, engagement, and human-centered storytelling. Each section of the site will be crafted to guide the user intuitively and tell a story. We will simplify the navigation and information architecture (see the sitemap below) to ensure clarity – users should immediately grasp where to find what they need, whether it’s inspiration, examples of Tangram’s work, or ways to connect with the team. Rather than a wide array of disjointed pages, the content will be organized into logical, user-friendly groupings (e.g. all case studies under one roof, all inspiration content in one hub). Clear labels and page introductions will help orient visitors, and quick links or calls-to-action will gently lead them toward deeper engagement (for example, a section on the homepage might highlight “Explore our Work” with a teaser image, inviting them into the Projects portfolio). Storytelling is at the heart of this new design. We will adopt a more narrative approach to content presentation. The homepage itself will feel like an opening chapter – starting with a strong mission statement or tagline that encapsulates Tangram’s value, followed by snippets of stories (a marquee project feature, a client quote, a statistic of impact) as you scroll. This engages visitors emotionally from the start. Key pages like About and Projects will be written in a tone that is confident and visionary yet conversational – avoiding dry corporate speak, instead sounding like a knowledgeable guide excited to share what’s possible. We maintain a warm tone, for example using inclusive language (“we collaborate with you…”, “let’s create…”), and celebrating people (clients, employees, end-users) in the narrative. The content will speak directly to design-minded decision makers by acknowledging what they care about: innovative ideas, proven results, and a sense of partnership. For instance, instead of just listing services, the copy might frame them in terms of the benefits to the client’s mission (“Tangram’s technology integration ensures your hybrid teams feel connected, no matter where they work”). This way, every piece of content is relatable and centered on human outcomes and experiences, rather than just features. To push innovation forward, the site will incorporate interactive storytelling techniques. Consider project case studies that allow users to explore: a project page might include an interactive slider comparing a before/after of a space, or a carousel of testimonial quotes from different stakeholders (an architect’s perspective, a client’s feedback, an employee’s remark about their new office). The “Inspiration” section could have filters or an interactive mood board where users click on a style or need (e.g. “collaborative spaces” or “wellness in design”) and see a curated selection of photos and tips. We will ensure these creative features remain intuitive – enhancing clarity, not causing confusion. The CMS-driven modular design means we can flexibly introduce such elements where they add value: because the site is built component-wise, adding a new story block or media type can be done consistently across pages. Another key experience aspect is lead generation woven seamlessly into the storytelling. Rather than hard sells or generic contact forms, the site will use contextual calls-to-action. For example, at the end of a case study about a healthcare project, a banner might read: “Planning a new healthcare space? Get in touch with our healthcare design team to explore ideas.” This speaks directly to the visitor’s interest, making the invitation to contact feel helpful and specific. Similarly, the About page can include a call-to-action for scheduling a visit to a Tangram showroom, or the Inspiration articles might end with “Liked these ideas? Let’s design your space together.” By placing these CTAs in context, we encourage outreach in a natural, human way – as a continuation of the conversation the content started. The Contact page itself will be welcoming and straightforward, offering multiple channels (a form, phone number, maybe a direct email to key personnel for different verticals) so that reaching out feels easy. In terms of technology and platform, the site will be fully responsive and optimized for all devices, with the immersive visuals scaling beautifully on large monitors down to mobile screens. The use of Sanity CMS will ensure content is not only easy to manage but also that we can create dynamic relationships – for example, linking products to the projects they appear in, or tagging inspiration posts with related industries so users can navigate those connections. Performance will also be a consideration: large visuals will be optimized or lazy-loaded to keep the site fast, ensuring that high-end design doesn’t compromise usability. Overall, the design direction merges digital creativity with clarity. It’s an experience that surprises and delights with visuals and interactive storytelling, yet always keeps the user’s needs front and center. By doing so, the new Tangram Interiors website will position the brand as forward-thinking and user-focused – a modern leader in the interiors industry that practices the human-centered philosophy it preaches, right down to its digital presence.
New Sitemap & Information Architecture
The proposed sitemap is organized to support storytelling, inspiration discovery, product exploration, and easy contact for various client types. Below is an outline of the new site structure with its key sections and pages:
Home: A full-width immersive landing page introducing Tangram’s brand. It will feature a strong headline (mission/tagline), a few high-impact visuals from signature projects, and teaser links into key areas (e.g. a highlight of a recent case study, a snippet of an inspiration article, and a call-to-action to contact or visit a showroom). The home page sets the narrative tone and quickly orients users to Tangram’s value proposition.
About: The story of Tangram Interiors and what makes it unique. This page will include the company’s mission and values, a brief history/legacy note (e.g. “Making amazing spaces since 1963…”), and what differentiates Tangram (such as being women-owned, community-focused, partner network, etc.). It will reinforce credibility and culture. Sub-pages or sections under About may include:
Studio / Team: A dedicated section (or page) focused on Tangram’s people and culture. It introduces key team members or leadership, highlights the multidisciplinary expertise (designers, project managers, technologists, etc.), and gives a sense of the creative studio environment. This could also encompass “Careers” or an invitation to “Join our team,” but primarily it’s geared toward clients seeing the human face of Tangram.
Locations: An area listing Tangram’s showrooms and offices (Southern California, Texas, etc.), with contact info and perhaps photos of each showroom. This helps local clients find a nearby Tangram presence and reinforces Tangram’s regional strength. (This might be integrated on the Contact page as well, but it’s listed for completeness).
Solutions (Services): An overview page for Tangram’s core service offerings, with brief descriptions and links to detailed pages for each service line. The overview might introduce Tangram’s holistic approach (“from furniture to tech to custom fabrication, we have you covered”) before breaking out into specifics. Subpages for each solution include:
Contract Furniture: Detailing Tangram’s furniture dealership services – what they offer (e.g. partnership with Steelcase and other brands, space planning expertise, custom furniture options). This page will use images of modern workspaces furnished by Tangram and possibly testimonials or stats (like project counts, client satisfaction) to build trust.
Architectural Walls: Explaining Tangram’s interior construction solutions – demountable walls, their benefits (flexibility, sustainability
tangraminteriors.com
), and examples of environments using them. Could include case snippets or product highlights (like particular wall systems).
Technology Integration: Showcasing how Tangram blends AV and tech into spaces – e.g. smart conference rooms, remote collaboration setups, interactive display installations. This page will appeal to IT and innovative clients, underlining that Tangram makes space and technology work together seamlessly.
Studio Other (Custom Design): Highlighting Tangram’s custom design/build studio. Content focuses on unique, tailor-made solutions Tangram has created – custom furniture pieces, one-of-a-kind installations – underscoring creativity and brand storytelling through space. Lots of visuals of bespoke work here to inspire.
Move & Facility Services: Outlining how Tangram supports clients beyond initial installation – relocation management, furniture maintenance, space reconfigurations, etc. This demonstrates Tangram’s end-to-end service and ongoing partnership with clients. Each service page will include a call-to-action (like “Learn more about this service” or “Contact our [Service] team” for inquiries), and will cross-link to related case studies or inspiration articles where that service played a key role.
Markets (Industries): A section dedicated to Tangram’s key client sectors, ensuring content resonates with specific audience needs. There will be an index or dropdown of industries, with each linking to a focused page. Industry pages include:
Workplace (Corporate Offices): Content tailored to corporate clients – trends in workplace design, challenges like hybrid work, and how Tangram addresses them. This page will showcase a few relevant projects (e.g. tech company HQs, creative offices) and products popular in offices, functioning as both inspiration and proof of expertise. Copy will speak the language of corporate decision-makers (productivity, company culture, brand expression in office design).
Healthcare: Focused on hospitals, clinics, wellness facilities. Discusses how Tangram creates healing environments, integrates technology in healthcare settings, and meets needs like durability and sanitation. Will feature case studies like medical office projects or hospital wings Tangram has done, and possibly highlight specific healthcare furniture solutions.
Higher Education: Targeting universities and colleges – content about active learning environments, student collaboration spaces, modern libraries, etc. Showcases Tangram’s work in higher ed (maybe student centers, classrooms) and addresses priorities like flexibility and innovation in learning spaces.
K-12 Education: Focused on schools and districts. Highlights how Tangram designs engaging, age-appropriate learning spaces, from agile classrooms to common areas. Could incorporate evidence of improved student engagement or test outcomes in Tangram-furnished schools (if available), appealing to school administrators.
(Note: If Tangram also serves other markets like Hospitality or Government, those could be included similarly. The above are the four explicitly mentioned in current materials
tangraminteriors.com
.) Each market page will include links to case studies in that sector, inspiration articles (if available, like a blog post on “Top 5 office design trends” linked on Workplace page), and a sector-specific contact CTA (e.g. “Contact our Workplace team”). This way, a visitor from, say, a university immediately sees content relevant to them and has a clear path to reach out.
Projects (Case Studies): A comprehensive portfolio hub showcasing Tangram’s storytelling and case studies. The Projects page will likely present a grid or list of featured projects with thumbnail images and key details (project name, location, sector). We will enable filtering or categories here – for example, users can sort or filter projects by industry (Workplace, Education, etc.) or by solution (if they want to see all projects involving Architectural Walls, for instance). Each project listed will link to a Project Detail page (case study). The Project Detail pages are where the narrative comes in: each will include an overview of the client and project scope, a gallery of photos (with possible sliders or embedded video), and sections detailing the project story (challenges, Tangram’s solutions, highlights, and outcomes). They will also credit partners (architects/designers like HLW in examples
tangraminteriors.com
), project team members, and other relevant metadata, as the current site does
tangraminteriors.com
. Crucially, these pages will be designed to support rich media and text in a modular way – ensuring each case study can be unique and engaging. The Projects section as a whole supports Tangram’s storytelling by providing real-world examples of their innovation and impact.
Inspiration (or Insights & Ideas): A new content hub for inspiration and curated spaces. This section serves as a blog/idea center that houses articles, trend reports, photo essays, and perhaps external news or publications featuring Tangram. Types of content here might include: “Design Trends” articles (e.g. “Biophilic Design in the Modern Office”), “Spaces We Love” features (curated case studies or inspirational projects from around the world that Tangram’s team admires, tying back to Tangram’s services), and thought leadership pieces by Tangram’s experts (like the existing journal pieces on furniture insights or interviews with team members). It could also include company news and press releases as part of the feed, but the primary framing is inspirational and informational rather than just corporate news. The Inspiration section will be organized so users can filter or browse by topic (e.g. Inspiration by Space Type, Insights by Industry, News etc.). This draws in visitors looking for fresh ideas and positions Tangram as a knowledgeable, creative authority. It’s also a softer lead-in for potential clients – someone browsing an article might realize Tangram understands modern design deeply and be inclined to reach out. Each article or inspiration entry could link to related projects or products (for example, a piece on “collaborative classrooms” could show a case study of a school Tangram did, or a product used in that context, with links).
Products: A dedicated furniture and product discovery section to showcase Tangram’s product offerings and make it easy for users to explore solutions. This will likely be a new addition (as the current site mentions products but doesn’t have a catalog-style interface). The Products section could be structured as follows: an introductory page that explains Tangram’s product range and partnerships (e.g. highlighting their Steelcase dealer status and other brand lines, plus their ability to provide custom pieces through Studio Other). Then, products could be browsed by category (for example: Seating, Desks & Workstations, Collaboration Furniture, Storage, Flooring, Technology, etc.). Each category page would list items (with thumbnails) and allow filtering perhaps by manufacturer or feature. Product Detail pages would show a large image (or multiple images) of the item, a description, specs or key features, and an inquiry link (like “Interested in this product? Contact us for pricing/options”). Because maintaining a full product catalog can be vast, this section might focus on curated or featured products that Tangram especially wants to showcase – such as innovative new products, popular solutions for each market, or Tangram’s own custom products. It’s less about listing every SKU and more about allowing discovery and inspiration. Importantly, product pages can link to related projects (e.g. “Seen in Project X”) to tie together how Tangram’s offerings come to life in real spaces. Likewise, project pages could list key products used, linking back to the product pages – creating a rich cross-linking that benefits both storytelling and user exploration. Overall, the Products section supports visitors (especially architects/designers or clients doing research) in finding tangible ideas and then connecting those ideas with Tangram’s services.
Contact: A user-friendly contact and lead generation page, designed to encourage inquiries from commercial clients across all verticals. This page will consolidate various contact options: a general inquiry form (with perhaps a dropdown for the type of inquiry: corporate office project, school project, showroom visit, etc., to route leads appropriately), phone numbers and emails for key regional offices or reps, and possibly a scheduling tool if Tangram offers consultations or showroom tours booking online. The contact page will also reiterate Tangram’s locations with addresses and a map, and might include a brief FAQ or note encouraging the visitor (e.g. “We’d love to talk about your project or even brainstorm ideas. No project is too big or small – reach out and our team will respond promptly.”). The tone remains warm and inviting. Additionally, throughout the site, contextual CTAs will drive visitors to this Contact page or specific contact actions (like a button on a sector page saying “Contact our Education Team”). In the navigation or footer, a persistent “Get in Touch” link will ensure contacting Tangram is always just one click away, supporting lead generation at every stage of the user journey.
(Aside from the above main sections, the site will naturally include persistent navigation and a robust footer. The footer might repeat key links, provide quick contact info, social media links, and perhaps a newsletter signup to capture leads via content as well. We will ensure the information architecture flows such that a user can navigate by their interest: e.g. by industry, by solution, or by exploring projects, all paths ultimately leading to engagement with Tangram’s team.) This new sitemap is designed to support storytelling, inspiration, product discovery, and lead gen in an integrated way. Users can easily find success stories and narratives (Projects), get ideas and knowledge (Inspiration), look at tangible solutions (Products), and reach out when ready (Contact) – all while learning about Tangram’s brand and capabilities (Home/About/Services). The structure is modular and scalable, so new content (like adding a new service or publishing a new article series) can fit in without disrupting the flow. Ultimately, this sitemap aims to make Tangram’s website a journey – from first impression to deeper exploration to action – rather than a set of separate pages.

Project Detail (Case Study Page)
(Example Project Title:) Confidential Media Client – Burbank, CA
(Subtitle: A global media company’s headquarters reimagined as a hub for innovation and creativity.) Overview: When a leading entertainment technology company set out to consolidate their operations into a new 52,000 sq. ft. headquarters, they envisioned more than just a larger office – they wanted a dynamic hub that would unite their teams and energize their work. Tangram Interiors partnered with their designers from day one to make that vision real. The result is a three-story creative campus in Burbank that marries high-performance technical spaces with vibrant, people-centric areas. From state-of-the-art sound studios to casual collision zones for impromptu collaboration, every square foot was designed to support both the precision of production work and the spark of creative teamwork. Challenge & Goals: The client’s goal was to establish nothing less than the Western Hemisphere’s flagship facility for their global brand. This meant world-class technical studios (for media localization and post-production) co-existing with an environment that could attract talent and foster community. Key challenges included stringent acoustical demands for recording rooms, seamless integration of AV technology, and creating an inviting atmosphere that reflected the company’s innovative spirit. All while bringing formerly separate teams under one roof and maintaining productivity during the transition. Tangram’s Solution: We tackled the project holistically – starting by understanding the workflow of editors, sound engineers, and support staff, and then designing spaces to elevate each aspect. Tangram provided a complete furniture and tech solution: ergonomic editing suites and control rooms equipped with smart consoles and sound-isolating materials; open collaboration lounges and a central café hub that encourage spontaneous interaction; and flexible workstations that can adapt as teams grow or projects change. We worked closely with the architect (HLW) to ensure that the furniture, architectural walls, and tech installations all harmonized. For instance, custom Tangram architectural wall systems create quiet zones for the studios, while our furniture choices in common areas – think cozy modular sofas and standing meeting tables – signal that this is a place where creativity is welcome. Warm wood finishes, pops of the client’s brand color, and curated decor pieces were used to make the high-tech space feel inviting and on-brand. Results: The new headquarters is a game-changer for our client. By consolidating all departments, communication is faster and the energy in the building is palpable. Employees report feeling more connected to their colleagues and the company’s mission – aided by the thoughtful mix of collaborative spaces and retreats for focus work. The technical teams have the cutting-edge facilities they need (several have called the sound stages “the best in the business”), and the informal gathering spots are sparking cross-pollination of ideas between departments. In short, this headquarters isn’t just a workspace – it’s become a creative community. As a proud partner in this project, Tangram helped a global leader transform their workplace into a living part of their brand story. (Client testimonial placeholder: “Our new HQ is driving innovation in ways we never imagined. Tangram’s team truly understood our needs and delivered a space that inspires us every day.” – Executive Sponsor) (Note: The above narrative is an illustrative example. Each Project Detail page on the actual site would be customized to the specific client story, potentially including unique sections like project timelines, before/after photos, and quotes from designers or end-users.)

Meet the Tangram Team: Designers, Dreamers, and Doers
Welcome to our studio – the heart of Tangram Interiors. Here, ideas buzz, collaboration is constant, and no challenge is too big. Our team is a diverse mix of talent: forward-thinking designers, meticulous project managers, skilled craftsmen, technology wizards, and client advocates. What unites us is a shared passion for creating environments where people thrive. We often say “our people are our greatest asset,” and we mean it – the creativity and care our team brings to each project are what make Tangram who we are. In our open studio space, you might find designers sketching out a concept for a futuristic office, samples of fabrics and finish materials spread across tables as palettes come together. Nearby, our technology experts huddle to integrate a new interactive display into a design, while project managers update timelines to ensure every install goes off without a hitch. It’s this seamless teamwork between different disciplines that allows Tangram to deliver holistic solutions. Collaboration is in our DNA – we bounce ideas off each other (often over a quick coffee in our own Tangram café area) and we believe the best solutions emerge when everyone’s voice is heard. Our leadership team brings decades of experience and vision, but we all contribute to Tangram’s culture of innovation. We celebrate creative thinking and initiative at every level. Have an idea to improve a client’s experience? Run with it. Want to explore a new sustainable material? Let’s prototype it. This empowering environment is why many of our team members have been with Tangram for 10, 20, even 30+ years – and also why new, young designers seek us out as a place to grow their careers. We’re smart, driven, and yes, pretty damn cool (if we say so ourselves!), and we channel that energy into building amazing spaces for our clients. When you partner with Tangram, you’re not just getting a vendor – you’re getting a whole team of friendly experts who have your back. We’ll assign a dedicated crew to your project, likely a mix of seasoned pros and fresh thinkers, all led by a project captain who ensures your vision is carried through.

Component-Based Design Recommendations
To build this new site in a modular, CMS-driven way (using Sanity and Cursor.sh for development), we recommend a component-based design system. This approach breaks pages into reusable blocks that can be mixed and matched, ensuring design consistency and making it easy for Tangram’s team to create or update content. Below are key layout modules and content components, along with suggestions for CMS structure and fields to support them:
Layout Modules & Reusable Components
Hero Banner Module: A full-width hero section for page tops. This component includes a background media (image or video), an overlay heading (H1) and subheading text, and an optional call-to-action button. Use: Homepage hero, section intros, project page top image with title. CMS fields: title text, subtitle text, background image/video, button text & link.
Text Block / Rich Content Module: A versatile content section for paragraphs of text, headings, and lists. Essentially a rich text editor output that can be styled in the design. Supports introducing bold headings, short paragraphs, bullet lists (for features or steps), and embedded links or inline images if needed. Use: General content sections like About page copy, project descriptions, inspiration articles. CMS fields: Portable Text (Sanity rich text) allowing headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes.
Image Gallery / Slider: A component to display multiple images, either as a grid gallery or a carousel slider. It can show thumbnails that open a lightbox or auto-rotate images. Use: Project detail pages (photo gallery of a project), Inspiration posts with multiple images, or a “featured projects” slider on the homepage. CMS fields: an array of images (each with alt text and optional caption field), plus settings for layout (grid vs. slider, number of columns, etc.).
Feature Cards / Icon Grid: A flexible grid of cards, each representing a feature, service, or category. Each card can contain an icon or image, a title, and short description, and possibly a link. Use: On the Solutions overview (to list the five service areas with icons), on the Products page (to show product categories), or even on the homepage to summarize key offerings. CMS fields: repeatable items with fields for icon/image, title, description (a few lines), and link URL.
Project/Case Study Card: A standardized teaser for a project, used in listing views. It includes a project cover image, project name, location or category, and maybe a one-liner or project type. The whole card links to the Project Detail page. Use: Projects overview page grid, related projects sections, maybe on industry pages to show projects in that industry. CMS fields: these draw from the Project entries in CMS (fields like project title, thumbnail image, location or sector tag). Could have a computed or manual excerpt field for the one-liner.
Testimonial / Quote Block: A stylized block to showcase a quote from a client or team member. It might have large quotation mark graphics, italicized text for the quote, and attribution (name, title, possibly headshot). Use: Could appear in project case studies (client testimonial), on the homepage or about page (client praise or a leadership quote), and in inspiration articles if needed. CMS fields: quote text, author name, author title, optional author image.
Statistics/Numbers Highlight: A component to display key metrics or achievements in a visually engaging way (often as large numbers with labels). For example, “50+ Years Experience”, “1000+ Projects Completed”, “Top 4 Dealer in US”. This could appear as a horizontal band or grid of stats. Use: About page to highlight Tangram’s scale, or even in case studies (project results, like “10 weeks timeline, 5 departments united”). CMS fields: repeatable list of stat items (each with number/value, label, optional icon).
Call-to-Action Banner: A full-width section, usually with a background color or image, containing a short text and a prominent button. Use: Typically at the end of pages (e.g. Contact CTA at bottom of a case study or service page: “Ready to discuss your project? Let’s talk.” [Contact Us button]). Also on homepage as a mid-section invite to see portfolio or contact. CMS fields: text (could be split into a headline and subtext), button text, button link, background image or color choice.
Navigation Menu & Footer: These are global components but designed modularly too. The nav bar might include dropdown menus for Solutions and Markets, plus a prominent “Contact” or “Get in Touch” button. It should be editable via CMS (for example, to add new menu items when new sections are added). The footer is a component with columns for quick links (navigation, maybe industries, services), contact info, social media, and a newsletter signup field. CMS fields: structured data for menu items (title and link, plus hierarchy for dropdowns), and for footer (lists of links, text for address, etc.). These components ensure consistency on every page and are managed in one place in CMS.
Inspiration/Blog Post List Item: Similar to project card, a component to list blog or inspiration entries with an image, title, and snippet. Use: Inspiration main page and related posts sections. CMS fields: drawn from Post schema (title, cover image, publish date, short excerpt).
Product Listing Card: A card for each product in a catalog view – showing product image, name, maybe a short category tag or description snippet. Links to the product detail page. Use: Products overview or category pages. CMS fields: from Product schema (name, thumbnail, category reference).
Product Detail Info Block: On a product page, aside from images and description text, we might have a block that lists product specifications or options in a neat table or list. Another block might show “Related Products” or “Used In Projects” which would be carousels of product cards or project cards respectively. These can be modular: e.g. a Related Items Carousel component that can display either products or projects based on context. CMS fields: relationships like references to other entries (product references for related products, project references for where used).
Each of these components will be designed to be reusable and configurable. For instance, the same Text Block module can be used for a simple paragraph section or expanded into a multi-column text layout if needed (by adding an option for columns in CMS). The Image Gallery module could be toggled between a masonry grid or a slideshow view via a setting. By building flexibility into each component, the site can maintain a consistent style while adapting to various content needs.
CMS Content Structure
In Sanity, we will create schemas for the major content types, structuring them to take full advantage of these components. Key schemas and their fields include:
Project (Case Study schema): Fields might include Title, Client Name, Location, Year, Industry/Market (reference or tag), Services Involved (multi-select or references to service types), a cover image, and then a flexible Content field (this could be an array of content blocks). For the content, we can use Sanity’s block content to allow rich text, but we might prefer a structured approach: e.g. an array of sections, where each section is one of the above components – such as a Text Section for the overview, an Image Gallery section, a Quote section, etc. This would allow the content creator to assemble the case study in the CMS by adding whatever modules are needed in sequence (Overview text, then maybe Goals as a text section, then an image, then Solutions as another text or list section, etc.). Additionally, fields for Project Team (an array of references to Team members), Partners (array of text or references if we list partner firms), and Photography credits could be included as in current site
tangraminteriors.com
tangraminteriors.com
. This structured content means each Project page is highly customizable while using the library of components.
Inspiration Post (or Blog/Article schema): Fields include Title, Author (could reference a Team member or just text), Publish Date, Main image, Excerpt (for listing), and Body Content which again can be portable text or modular sections. Likely a rich text is fine here for the main body, combined with an option to insert images or quote components in between text. Tags or categories can classify posts (e.g. “Trend”, “News”, “Case Study”, etc.) for filtering. This schema powers the Inspiration section.
Product schema: Fields for Product Name, Category (reference to a Category document or just a string), Description (rich text or structured), Images (array of image objects), and any key specifications (could have a list of key–value pairs like Dimensions, Materials, available Colors, etc.). We should also have a field for related content, e.g. related projects (reference array to Projects where this product was used) to enable that cross-linking. Vice versa, Projects might have a list of featured products (reference to Product entries) if Tangram wants to curate that on case studies. The Product schema makes the product pages CMS-driven and easily updatable when new offerings come.
Service schema (for each Solution page like Contract Furniture, etc.): Fields for Service Name, Description (rich text for the page content), possibly an icon/image, and perhaps a list of key points or offerings. Could also include a reference to a contact person or a default CTA link. The content for service pages might be relatively static text + images, so a simpler schema with a portable text field could suffice, or we could utilize components for more complex layouts (like intermixing images and text).
Market (Industry) schema: Fields for Industry Name (e.g. “Workplace”), Intro Text (to set the context as on those pages), maybe a banner image, and references to related Projects and Inspiration posts. We can use these references to automatically display “Featured projects in Workplace” on the Workplace page, etc., or allow manual selection of which projects to feature. A dedicated field for a CTA text/recipient could allow customizing the contact prompt (like “Contact our Corporate Interiors team” and an email link or form target).
Team Member schema: For the Studio/Team page and elsewhere (like author attributions). Fields: Name, Title/Role, Bio, Photo, and any additional info (location, expertise tags, etc.). This can feed an interactive team directory or just be used to list key leaders with bios on the Team page. We might not expose every member, but having them in CMS allows easily adding profiles.
General Page schema: We might want a flexible page type for simple pages or microsites (like the personalized microsite in current site). However, given we have specific sections for most things, a general page builder might not be immediately necessary. But we could allow an “Additional Content Page” type with a title and content blocks array for any future one-off needs (for example, a landing page for a special event or a unique campaign).
Crucially, these schemas interrelate to maximize reusability. For example: a Project entry references which market(s) it belongs to and which products are used; an Inspiration post can reference related projects or services. This way, the website can dynamically pull in content – e.g., on a Healthcare industry page, automatically list projects that have “Healthcare” tagged, or on a product page, show links to projects that used that product. Sanity’s structure will enable these dynamic links, making the site feel very cohesive and rich without extra manual effort to update multiple places. The CMS field structure is designed to empower Tangram’s marketing or content team. They can add a new case study by filling in a form for the project and assembling the story with predefined section blocks (no coding needed, just selecting components and entering text/images). If there’s a need for a new type of content block in the future (say, a video embed section or a 360° tour embed), the developers can create a new component and add it to the CMS as another option in the array – all existing pages remain intact and new pages can start using the new block. This modular setup ensures longevity and adaptability of the site. For Cursor.sh development, these components will correspond to React/Vue/Svelte components (whichever stack Cursor uses) that fetch data from Sanity. Developers can build each module as a partial and then create page templates that iterate over the content arrays to render each section. Because the design system is well-defined, we avoid one-off styles and ensure every piece of content, no matter who adds it, will look on-brand. In summary, the component-driven design and supporting CMS structure will make Tangram’s new website highly flexible, easy to maintain, and scalable. Content creators will be free to focus on storytelling and accuracy, using an array of attractive templates, while the underlying design stays consistent and engaging. This approach not only streamlines development with Cursor but also sets Tangram up with a sustainable digital platform that can grow and evolve alongside the brand.
