# Product Tagging System - User Guide

## üéØ Overview

The Product Tagging System allows content managers to create interactive project case studies by tagging products directly on project images. This creates an immersive experience where visitors can click on hotspots to learn about specific furniture, technology, and design elements.

- Ensure good lighting and clear product visibility
- Avoid cluttered compositions for easier tagging
- Consider the image aspect ratio (16:9 works best)

### **Product Tagging Tips:**
- **Be Specific**: Use exact product names and model numbers
- **Strategic Placement**: Tag 3-5 key products per image (avoid overcrowding)
- **Accurate Positioning**: Click precisely on the product you're tagging
- **Consistent Naming**: Use manufacturer names consistently (e.g., always "Herman Miller" not "HM")

### **Content Writing:**
- **Image Titles**: Be descriptive but concise
- **Descriptions**: Tell a story about how the space functions
- **Specifications**: Include key features that matter to clients
- **Sustainability**: Highlight environmental benefits when relevant

## üé® Visual Guidelines

### **Hotspot Appearance:**
- Orange circles (#f9a31c) with white borders
- Numbered sequence (1, 2, 3...)
- Subtle pulsing animation to draw attention
- 24px diameter for optimal visibility

### **Product Information:**
- Clean, minimal popup design
- Product name as primary information
- Category and price prominently displayed
- Partner/manufacturer attribution
- Optional detailed specifications

## üîß Technical Notes

### **Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  image: SanityImageAsset,
  title: "Reception Area",
  description: "Welcoming space with biophilic design",
  spaceType: "reception",
  productTags: [
    {
      x: 25.5,  // Percentage from left
      y: 45.2,  // Percentage from top
      customProduct: {
        name: "Steelcase Gesture Chair",
        category: "seating",
        price: "$1,200",
        partner: "Steelcase"
      }
    }
  ],
  metrics: [
    {
      metric: "Visitor Satisfaction",
      value: "96%",
      change: "+23%"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Frontend Display:**
- Automatic responsive scaling
- Hover interactions with smooth animations
- Mobile-friendly touch interactions
- Graceful fallback for images without tags

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

**"Upload an image first to enable product tagging"**
- Make sure you've uploaded an image in the Image field before trying to tag

**Tags appear in wrong positions**
- This can happen if the image is resized after tagging
- Re-upload the image and re-tag if necessary

**Product information not saving**
- Ensure all required fields (Name, Category, Price) are filled
- Check for special characters that might cause issues

**Hotspots not appearing on frontend**
- Verify the project is published in Sanity
- Check that the tagged images field has data
- Ensure the frontend is pulling from the correct dataset

### **Support:**
For technical issues or questions:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify Sanity Studio connectivity
3. Contact the development team with specific error details

## üìä Content Strategy
