# Webflow → Sanity Migration: CSV vs API

## 🤔 **Your Question:**
> "would migration from webflow to sanity be easier done via API or csv export/import"

## 🎯 **Direct Answer:**

**API is significantly easier for Webflow → Sanity** because:

### **Why API Wins for CMS Migrations:**

1. **Image Handling** 
   - **CSV**: URLs → Manual download → Manual upload → URL references 
   - **API**: Image objects → Sanity Asset API → Proper image references ✅

2. **References & Relationships**
   - **CSV**: `"John Doe, Jane Smith"` → String parsing → Manual lookups
   - **API**: `[{id: "123", name: "John"}]` → Direct mapping ✅

3. **Schema Structure**
   - **CSV**: Flat data → Manual object construction → Type conversion
   - **API**: Structured objects → Direct transformation ✅

4. **Future Maintenance**
   - **CSV**: Schema changes break migrations
   - **API**: Update field mappings only ✅

## 📊 **What You Experienced (CSV Issues):**

```javascript
// Your CSV approach had these pain points:
imageUrls[`image${i === 1 ? 'One' : 'Two'...`] = imageUrl  // Complex image handling
const teamReferences = await getTeamMemberReferences(project.Team, sanityClient)  // String parsing
location: {
  streetAddress: project['Street Address'],  // Manual field mapping
  cityState: project['City, State'],        // Hope headers don't change
}
```

## 🚀 **How API Would Look:**

```javascript
// Clean API approach:
headshot: await sanity.assets.upload(employee.photo.url)  // Let Sanity handle images
team: webflowProject.teamMembers.map(m => ({ _ref: m.id }))  // Direct mapping
address: {
  street: project.address.street,    // Structured data
  city: project.address.city
}
```

## 💡 **Bottom Line:**

- **CSV works** for simple, flat data migrations ✅
- **API is better** for complex CMS content with images and relationships ✅
- **Your CSV approach succeeded** but created schema debt ⚠️
- **API approach prevents** the schema adaptation issues you experienced ✅

## 📋 **For Your Situation:**

1. **Current migration**: Let it finish - it's working! ✅
2. **Future updates**: Use the API approach I provided ✅
3. **Next CMS migration**: Definitely use API ✅

**TL;DR**: API is easier for CMS migrations because it preserves structure and relationships that CSV flattens.
